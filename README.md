# Encoding
Temporary presentation

## What is Encoding?
Information must be encoded into signals before it can be transported across communication media. We must encode data into signals to send them from one place to another. 
To send digital information, we must devise analog signals to represent bits. The process of converting between bits and signals that represent them is called digital modulation.
